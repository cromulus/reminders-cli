# Reminders CLI Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration that connects to the reminders-api to sync macOS Reminders as native Home Assistant todo lists.

## Features

- ✅ Each reminder list becomes a separate Home Assistant todo entity
- ✅ Full CRUD support (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Set due dates and descriptions
- ✅ Mark items as complete/incomplete
- ✅ GUI-configurable with connection validation
- ✅ Real-time updates (30-second polling)
- ✅ Optional authentication token support

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.11 or later (for todo platform support)
- reminders-api server running and accessible
- (Optional) API authentication token

## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/reminders_cli` directory to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/home-assistant/config
   mkdir -p custom_components
   cp -r /path/to/reminders-hassio-todo/custom_components/reminders_cli custom_components/
   ```

2. Restart Home Assistant

3. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**

4. Search for "Reminders CLI" and click to add it

### Method 2: HACS (when published)

1. Open HACS
2. Go to Integrations
3. Click the three dots in the top right
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL
6. Install "Reminders CLI"

## Configuration

### Setup via UI

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for and select **Reminders CLI**
4. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Name**: A friendly name for this integration (e.g., "My Reminders")
   - **API Server URL**: The URL of your reminders-api server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`)
   - **API Token** (optional): Your API authentication token if required

5. Click **Submit**

The integration will validate the connection before saving. If the connection fails, you'll see an error message.

### Entities Created

After setup, the integration will create one todo list entity for each of your reminder lists:

- `todo.{list_name}` - Todo list for each reminders list

For example, if you have lists named "Work", "Personal", and "Shopping", you'll get:
- `todo.work`
- `todo.personal`
- `todo.shopping`

## Usage

### In the Home Assistant UI

1. Go to the **To-do** page in the sidebar
2. You'll see all your reminder lists
3. Click on any list to:
   - Add new items
   - Mark items complete/incomplete
   - Edit item details (title, description, due date)
   - Delete items

### In Automations

```yaml
# Example: Add a reminder when someone arrives home
automation:
  - alias: "Add reminder on arrival"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.john
        to: "home"
    action:
      - service: todo.add_item
        target:
          entity_id: todo.personal
        data:
          item: "Check the mail"
          due_date: "{{ now().date() }}"
```

```yaml
# Example: Get notification when high-priority items are added
automation:
  - alias: "Notify on new urgent item"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: todo.work
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state | int > trigger.from_state.state | int }}"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "New work item added!"
```

## API Compatibility

This integration is compatible with reminders-api v1.0.0+. It uses the following endpoints:

- `GET /lists` - Fetch all lists
- `GET /lists/:name` - Fetch reminders from a list
- `POST /lists/:name/reminders` - Create a reminder
- `PATCH /lists/:name/reminders/:id` - Update a reminder
- `PATCH /lists/:name/reminders/:id/complete` - Mark complete
- `PATCH /lists/:name/reminders/:id/uncomplete` - Mark incomplete
- `DELETE /lists/:name/reminders/:id` - Delete a reminder

## Troubleshooting

### Integration won't connect

1. Verify the reminders-api server is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/lists
   ```

2. Check if authentication is required and token is correct:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/lists
   ```

3. Check Home Assistant logs for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -f /config/home-assistant.log | grep reminders_cli
   ```

### Items not updating

- The integration polls for updates every 30 seconds
- Force a refresh by reloading the integration in Settings → Devices & Services
- Check the coordinator logs for API errors

### Authentication errors

- Ensure your API token is correct
- Verify the reminders-api is configured to accept the token
- Try connecting without a token if auth is optional

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run Home Assistant integration tests
pytest tests/
```

### Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.reminders_cli: debug
```
